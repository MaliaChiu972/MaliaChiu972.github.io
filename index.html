				Hello my name is Malia and welcome to my webpage about my small family. My family consists of myself, my 2 dogs and my mom.</p>

				The photo on the left is one I took at the Round 1 arcade in Hayward. My friend and I went there for my friends birthday and we spent a lot of time trying to get those plushies. I like to hangout with my friends whenever possible especially since we can all be pretty busy. I love to go out and explore new places with them or even just hangout at one of our houses and watch shows or play games. My other friends got me a Nintendo switch for my birthday 2 years ago and I am so grateful to them and try to use it as much as possible. One of my favorite games is Hades and I recommend it if you are able to play it. Some games that I am currently playing are Fortnite and Omega Strikers. Surprisingly Fortnite is extremely fun to play with friends in my opinion. You can just run around and explore or do wacky things like drive into everyone or slice them with a katana. At the moment there is a Star Wars event where you can learn the force to either throw rocks at things, pull things to you, or push them away. Too bad there is no lightning. </p>

				Aside from games I like to go on walks with my family or friends whenever they are free. I like near the water so it is always nice to go out and enjoy the breeze and the view. As well as allow others to experience it as well.
