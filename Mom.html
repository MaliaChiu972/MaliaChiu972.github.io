			<p>This is my Mom. She is one of the Best moms in the world and I don't know what I would do without her in my life. She raised me for most of my life as a single parent. </p>
			<p>Long story short I am adopted from China and have lived in America, in the same house since I was 8 months old. I am extremely grateful for all the opportunities that my mom has given me and all the sacrifices she has made for me. I am glad that I got to grow up in an amazing and supportive household, as well as a safe neighborhood/ environment. I know that it is not easy taking care of another living being let alone try and raise and guide them to be the best that they can be.</p>
			<p> My mom and I can be opposites sometimes in terms of me being an introvert while she is an extrovert. I do love all the things she got me interested in at a young age. Like animals, sports, and art. When I was young we would play racquetball at health club that she used to work at and teach racquetball there. Sadly both of us a mobility challenged due to personal injuries, but I love whenever we have the time to go for a long walk with the dogs, near the water. I also enjoy just having small talk while watching a show or when helping to prepare food. 
			<p> When I show my mom this I want her to know how much I love and cherish all the things that she has done for me and know that if I could change anything about how she brought me up I wouldn't change a thing. </p>
			<h2> I LOVE YOU MOM!!!</h2>
